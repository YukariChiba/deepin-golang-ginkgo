.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Ginkgo is a BDD-style Golang testing framework built to help you efficiently
write expressive and comprehensive tests.

This page documents the
.B ginkgo
CLI, which offers a number of conveniences beyond what \fBgo test\fR provides out
of the box and its usage is recommended, but not necessary.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR \fIflags\fR \fIpackages\fR -- \fIpass-throughs\fR
Run the tests in \fIpackages\fR (or the package in the current directory).

Any arguments after \fB--\fR will be passed to the test.
Run \fBginkgo test\fR for a description of all valid flags.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR watch \fIflags\fR \fIpackages\fR -- \fIpass-throughs\fR
Watches the files in  \fIpackages\fR and re-runs tests when changes occur.

Any arguments after \fB--\fR will be passed to the test.
Accepts all the flags that the \fBginkgo\fR command accepts except for
\fB--keepGoing\fR and \fB--untilItFails\fR.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR bootstrap \fIflags\fR
Bootstrap a test suite for the current package

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR generate \fIfilenames\fR
Generate a test file named \fIfilename\fR_test.go

If the optional \fIfilenames\fR argument is omitted, a file named after the
package in the current directory will be created.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR nodot
Update the nodot declarations in your test suite

Any missing declarations (from, say, a recently added matcher) will be added to
your bootstrap file.
If you've renamed a declaration, that name will be honored and not overwritten.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR convert \fI/path/to/package\fR
Convert the package at the specified path from an XUnit-style test to a
Ginkgo-style test

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR unfocus
Recursively unfocuses any focused tests under the current directory
